        <p>The virtual world. A world that is completely separate from the real world. A simulation. It's like you are interacting with a world around you that doesn't exist. In the 2010's, virtual reality has never been so advanced. With the ever-evolving use of computing and technology, more people are starting to get a grasp on virtual reality as the video game industry and the work forces started to adopt VR technology. We are going into an era where it is going to be the future of how we perceive the virtual world all around us. It would change the industry, the social impact, and the way we work on our lives as we know it. Now, with the development of eXtended Reality, that would change the various industries that used existing VR technology. On this site, you will learn about the recent development of the next step in virtual reality in our ever-growing and evolving use of technology and beyond.<br><br>To start, please click on the selections at the navigation bar on the top.</p>
