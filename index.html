        <p>The virtual world. A world that is completely seperate from the real world. A simulation. It's like you are interacting the world around you that doesn't exist. In other cases, there are moments and times where virtual objects join in the real world, or real-world objects inside a virtual world. In the 2010's, the virtual reality experience has never been so advanced. With the ever-evolving use of computing and technology, more people are starting to get a grasp on virtual reality as the video game industry and the work forces started to adopt VR technology. We are going into an era where it is going to be the future of how we percieved the virtual world around us. It would change the industry, the social impact, and the way we work on our lives as we know it. Now, with the development of eXtended Reality, that would change the various industries that used existing VR technology. On this site, you will learn about the recent development of the next step in virtual reality in our ever-growing and evolving use of technology and beyond.<br><br>To start, please click on the selections at the menu bar on the top.</p>

            <h2>Our chosen innovation</h2>
            <p>We have chose this innovation in the world of Computing and Technology. It is the most recent and continuously developed piece of technology that will soon be coming in the next couple of years. Even though there are multiple variations of virtual reality out there, this type of VR is in development for a number of years. It is still being worked on to perfection, and it will take a little while to get it there to the point where the virtual world blends in with the real world.<br><br>To learn more about eXtended Reality, click on the link at the top labeled <i>About XR (eXtended Reality)</i>.</p>
