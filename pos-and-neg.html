        <h1>Advantages and Disadvantages of XR plus its impact on Society and the World</h1>
        <p>Like with many innovations and experiements, eXtended Reality has its own upsides and downsides when it comes to health and safety, privacy and security, and the technology that is used.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The eXtended Reality technologies will combine all aspects of virtual simulation technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR) into one single techonology that will faciliate all of the different aspects of virtual simulation.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>eXtended Reality technologies opens the concern for privacy and security reasons focusing on how it stores information on the people that is using the device as well as other personal info that the use may have.</li>
                    <li>The eXtended Reality technologies will cost more than with AR, MR, and VR technologies in the same era</li>
                    <li>eXtended Reality technologies is at an early stage of development, and so may exhibit slight issues and also not perform as well as with existing virtual simulation technologies like AR, MR, and VR regarding motion controls, lighting generation, the number of polygons and the processing power required to run the technology.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Impact on Society and the World</h2>
            <p>As the technology is at its early stage, it would soon be available to the whole world in the next five years, as most people often predicted when XR finally comes to play between the AR, MR, and VR technologies. By 2025, companies, businesses, millitaries, and many other institutions will soon start using this new technologies in a wide variety of levels based on the virtuallity spectrum of eXtended Reality.</p>
